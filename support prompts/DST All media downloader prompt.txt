okay, i want to create a new project called dian sybex tech <all media downloader/> 
this will be a website that can download any type of media(tiktok, youtube, instagram, facebook, pinterest, spotify, songs and also make searches) in any format(video, audio and document)
this will all be made posible by use of APIs that i will provide individually for each media type 
[i will provide the css that we'll use ]
*styles.css*

                 <STRUCTURE OF THE SITE>
The site will have a banner with the company name(DianSybexTech) with a home buttton directing to "https://dian-sybex-tech.vercel.app" 
below the banner will be the site that we are going to download from ie {(yt logo)Youtube}, {(tiktok logo)Tiktok}, 
below with a search bar, where inputs or searches are inserted .
then the remaining space below should have the search results if the input was a search
some inputs will be direct links that need to be downloaded directly but inputs like songs, youtube searches , spotify , can be searches 
INCLUDE ALL THE CSS AND JS IN ONE HTML FILE, 
                     STRUCTURE OF THE SITE/>

                <STRUCTURE OF SEARCH RESULTS>
Search results should have a download button that downloads the returned media, must show the views/streams , likes where applicable plus the thumbnail of the media
               <STRUCTURE OF SEARCH RESULTS/>

                <API logic>
we will be using the gifted api for performing all this 
each media type has a specific api it will be using, ill provide all the necessary apis and their documantation if nessesary
                 <API logic/>

             <APIs>

to reduce on complexity of the site, we should create a different page for each media type and then create a home or main page that links to all of them
but we will create one page at a time (we create one for the API i provide) at first we'll create the main page and then the first downloading site.
we will lastly create a page with credits and guidelines about how to use the site

also make sure to include my google tag script for analystics on each page: 
 ( <!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-8VL9P86LQJ"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-8VL9P86LQJ');
</script>)



THE css file i have provided shows what you should majorly include on the main page 


*IF IT IS POSSIBLE , WE CAN CREATE ONE SIMPLE DYNAMIC PAGE THAT CAN DOWNLOAD ALL MEDIA BUT WITH BUTTONS FOR SELECTING THE MEDIA TYPE TO BE SEARCHED OR DOWNLOADED BUT WHILE KEEPING THE MAIN PAGE *
this will be for you to decide on either one dynamic page with a separate main page or a page for every download media
